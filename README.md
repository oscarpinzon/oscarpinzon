# Hi, I'm Oscar 👋
**Full-Stack Software Engineer**

Shipping user-facing features and keeping releases boring (in the best way).
I work across frontend, backend, and platform: building product features, tightening CI/CD, and leaving systems cleaner than I found them.

## Highlights
- Shipped features across multiple edtech SaaS products used by **30k+ subscribers**.
- Cut **blue-green deploys from 60 → 10 minutes** using Terraform and AWS pipelines.
- Reduced **critical defects ~30%** and improved **page-load ~20%** through testing and perf work.

## What I’m working on
- **Shipping:** small, production-ready examples that mirror real job tasks (CI/CD, deploys, APIs).
- **Learning:** modern React patterns, .NET minimal APIs, CI/CD best practices.

## Selected projects
- **Accessible Combobox (React/TS)** — component with Storybook, tests, and CI setup. Shows component design, testing, and library ergonomics.
