# Hi, I'm Oscar 👋

I build product features and improve the systems around them, shipping fast without breaking things.

**Full-Stack Software Engineer**

I work across the stack, building user-facing features, improving delivery pipelines, and leaving systems cleaner than I found them.

## Highlights

- Shipped features across multiple edtech products used by **30k+ subscribers**
- Cut **deployment time by 80%** (60 → 10 minutes)
- Reduced **critical defects ~30%** and improved **page load times ~20%**

## What I'm working on

**Building:** production-style projects that show how I work—CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, API design.

**Learning:** modern frontend patterns, lightweight backend APIs, delivery pipeline best practices.

## Selected projects

**Accessible Combobox** — A reusable autocomplete component with documentation, tests, and automated checks. Demonstrates component design, accessibility standards, and library ergonomics.
